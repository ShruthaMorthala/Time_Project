# Time_Project
This project was one of my main submissions from a course called Web Developement. The main theme for that corresponding semester was Time, and we had to create one HTML file using two different css's and a javascript file. The point of this assignment was to use to two different css's which help convey two different moods to one single html file. I wanted to focus on concepts like growth and patience in the context of time, and decided to create my own animations and poetry text to convey my version of time.
